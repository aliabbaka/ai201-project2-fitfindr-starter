## The Mock Listings Dataset

`data/listings.json` contains 40 mock secondhand listings across categories (tops, bottoms, outerwear, shoes, accessories) and styles (vintage, y2k, grunge, cottagecore, streetwear, and more).

Each listing has: `id`, `title`, `description`, `category`, `style_tags`, `size`, `condition`, `price`, `colors`, `brand`, and `platform`.

Load it with:
```python
from utils.data_loader import load_listings
listings = load_listings()
```

## The Wardrobe Schema

`data/wardrobe_schema.json` defines the format your agent uses to represent a user's existing wardrobe. It includes:

- `schema`: field definitions for a wardrobe item
- `example_wardrobe`: a sample wardrobe with 10 items you can use for testing
- `empty_wardrobe`: a starting template for a new user

Load an example wardrobe with:
```python
from utils.data_loader import get_example_wardrobe
wardrobe = get_example_wardrobe()
```

## Tool Inventory

Your README submission must document each tool's name, inputs, and return value. **These must exactly match your actual function signatures in `tools.py`.** Your documented interfaces will be checked against your actual function signatures in `tools.py` — if the parameter count or types contradict what's in the code, you may not receive full credit for that tool.

## Interaction Walkthrough

<!-- Walk through a complete interaction step by step: natural language query → each tool call (and why) → final fit card.
     Walk through this carefully — it's how graders follow your agent's reasoning without a live demo.
     Use a specific example — do not leave this as a template. -->

**User query:**

**Step 1 — Tool called:**
- Tool: search_listings
- Input: description=" rust-colored cords ", size="L", max_price="20"
- Why this tool: to ease the searching process by narrowing the database to only those that matches the query
- Output: less clothes from the list

**Step 2 — Tool called:**
- Tool: suggest_outfit
- Input: new_item:step 1 output clothes, wardrobe= what the user already have
- Why this tool: it can help the user with decreasing the amount of time they spend in choosing clothes type by picking it for them
- Output: matching outfit of the day

**Step 3 — Tool called:**
- Tool: create_fit_card
- Input: outfit= the output of step2, new_item= what the user have already chosen from step 1
- Why this tool: it works as the derciption of the oufit, it tells the user what he is about to wear 
- Output: a sentese that description of the output 

**Final output to user:**

## Error Handling and Fail Points

<!-- For each tool, describe the specific failure mode and what your agent does in response.
     This maps to the error handling section of the rubric (F5-C1). -->

| Tool | Failure mode | Agent response |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `search_listings` |does not find a fit related to the query | No such item can be found|
| `suggest_outfit` | can't find a match| will respond with a wrong match that does not align |
| `create_fit_card` | it will describe the wrong things |saying the size is blue or can't match the types |

---

## Spec Reflection

<!-- Answer both questions with at least 2–3 sentences each. -->

**One way planning.md helped during implementation:**
tells me what each catgory stores such as size will not be a float but a string
**One divergence from your spec, and why:**

---

## Where to Start

1. **Read `planning.md` and fill it out before writing any code.**
2. Verify the data loads correctly by running `python utils/data_loader.py`.
3. Build and test each tool individually before connecting them through your planning loop.

Your implementation files go in this same directory. There's no required file structure for your agent code — organize it however makes sense for your design.
